# Update for Visual Studio 2017

Dear Reader,

With the release of Visual Studio 2017, Microsoft has replaced the `project.json` file with an XML file called `<projectname>.csproj`.

These changes do not have a significant impact on the examples in this book: ASP.NET Core MVC works in the same way, using the same NuGet packages. The difference is how those packages are added to the project.
This folder contains new chapters to help you in the transition to Visual Studio 2017 and the new `csproj` files.

The *Using Visual Studio 2017* chapter takes you through the process of getting Visual Studio set up and recreates the *Party Invites* project from the book. The remaining chapters are replacements for the *SportsStore* section of the book and show you how to build the project using Visual Studio 2017.

The other change of note is that creating unit testing projects is simpler with Visual Studio 2017. You can see an example of this in the replacement for Chapter 8, which explains the new process.

To accompany these chapters, you will find a complete set of project files that have been created using Visual Studio 2017.

I hope that these chapters will make the switch to the new .NET Core tools simple and painless. If you get stuck, you can email me at `adam@adam-freeman.com` and I will try to help you get back on track.
